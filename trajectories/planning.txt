This is a complex and comprehensive query about the environmental impact of electric vehicles vs. traditional cars. Let me break this down:
Assessment and breakdown:
The user is asking for a detailed comparison covering 10 specific areas:

Manufacturing emissions and environmental costs
Operational emissions during use
End-of-life disposal and recycling impacts
Raw material extraction impacts
Infrastructure impacts
Lifecycle carbon footprint analysis
Other environmental factors (air quality, noise, water usage)
Regional variations based on electricity sources
Current trends and projections
Latest data and studies from 2024-2025

This requires specific data, statistics, and recent authoritative sources including peer-reviewed studies, government reports, and environmental organizations.
Query type determination:
This is a depth-first query because:

It requires multiple perspectives on the same central issue (EV vs ICE environmental impact)
Benefits from different methodological approaches (manufacturing analysis, operational analysis, lifecycle analysis, etc.)
The core question is singular but benefits from diverse analytical approaches
Each aspect contributes unique insights to the central comparison

Detailed research plan development:
For this depth-first query, I need to deploy subagents to explore different methodological approaches:

Manufacturing & Raw Materials Subagent: Focus on manufacturing emissions, battery production vs engine/transmission production, and raw material extraction impacts (lithium, cobalt, rare earth metals vs petroleum extraction)
Operational Emissions & Grid Analysis Subagent: Focus on operational emissions during use, considering different electricity grid mixes globally and regionally, plus regional variations
Lifecycle & End-of-Life Subagent: Focus on lifecycle carbon footprint analysis, end-of-life disposal and recycling impacts, plus infrastructure impacts
Environmental Factors & Trends Subagent: Focus on other environmental factors (air quality, noise pollution, water usage), current trends and projections, and gathering the latest 2024-2025 studies

I'll strategically coordinate these subagents to maximize research efficiency and comprehensive coverage. Parallel deployment will allow simultaneous investigation of each critical environmental dimension, ensuring a robust and multifaceted analysis of electric versus traditional vehicles.
